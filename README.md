## Technologies
For this project, we utilized Socket.io, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, Handlebars, Bootstrap, HTML and Git.

## Development
Our development cycle was split into two parts, implementing Socket.io and user authentication features. The most important and difficult aspect of the project was implementing the socket.io package into our application. Socket.io is a technology that allows users to access the same chatting screen to send and retrieve messages in realtime. The second part of project was creating authentication features, such as user registration and login.
